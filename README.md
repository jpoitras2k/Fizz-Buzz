# Fizz-Buzz
Simple Fizz-Buzz math logic

This program counts from 1 to 100 and when the number is divisible by 3 it prints Fizz, when the number is divisible by 5 it prints Buzz and when the number is divisible by 3 and 5 it returns Fizz Buzz.  Else the number is printed.  I chose to create this as a self challenge after doing some initial course from CodeCademy.  It was written using Thonny IDE in Python 3.6
